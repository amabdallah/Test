Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM) is proposed organize, describe, and manipulate network-based data with emphasis on water systems and water management data. The design of the WaM-DaM allows users to represent a node and link network of water management system components like reservoirs, canals, water use sites, and operations that involve those components. The data model also supports structured metadata fields that describe who collected data for the components, how and where the data were collected.
