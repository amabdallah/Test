Key Features of WaM-DaM 
=======================

The following are the key features of WaM-DaM that contributes to the exisitng state of the art data models:

1. **Define the connectivity between objects like sites through links**
For example, WaM-DaM allows you to organize data that comprise a network of nodes and links 

2. **Organize multiple data formats like time series, text, multi-column, and parameters from different sources**
WaM-DaM adopts the principles of representing time series data as in the Observation Data Model. WaM-DaM organizes multi-columns data in a relational format that allows users to query pieces of data inside each multi-columns table.  

3. **Overcome semantic heterogeneity in water management data**
WaM-DaM uses controlled vocabularies to enforce the homogeneity of object (nodes and links) names throughout the network

4. **Allows direct conditional data queries**
WaM-DaM is a relational data model that allows users to access samll pieces of data with sophisticated conditions.
