The Objects table is a container that describes general metadata for nodes and links (e.g., reservoir and canal). Each object can be associated with one or more attributes. For example, a reservoir can have attributes like capacity, dam height, and inflow. The use of node and link object names is controlled by a set of vocabularies like “Reservoir” and “Canal”. Finally, the Attributes table defines one or more parameters or variables like elevation and storage for an Object.  


#### Node Objects ####
Node objects represnet a generic abstract of a node like reservoir. A node instance inherits all the properties of a node object.   

** Node Objects Category**
Node objects that are similar and belong to a large group of objects can be organized in categories under a hierarchical order. For example, urban water management objects like culvert, wastewater treatment plant, and manhole can be organized in one category called wastewater. In the meanwhile, culverts and manholes can belong to the wastewater treatment plant object as of their parent
