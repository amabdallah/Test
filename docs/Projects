In WaM-DaM, projects provid general information about the user who creates or gathers data in WaM-DaM, the project which the user is working on, the objects the user creates for their project, and their attributes. These objects and their attributes can be reused for many networks. The Users table organizes data about the user name, organization, address, etc. A user can create zero or many projects. The Projects table contains all the data and metadata of the user’s work. It has metadata like the project name and its description. It can have zero or many networks. The Objects table is a container that describes general metadata for nodes and links (e.g., reservoir and canal). Each object can be associated with one or more attributes. For example, a reservoir can have attributes like capacity, dam height, and inflow. The use of node and link object names is controlled by a set of vocabularies like “Reservoir” and “Canal”. Finally, the Attributes table defines one or more parameters or variables like elevation and storage for an Object.
