Defining an ontology for the Water Management Data Model
========================================================
Overview
The Water Management Data Model (WaM-DaM) is proposed to be a universal standard to search, organize, describe, and manipulate water systems network-based data and metadata. There are four aspects of WaM-DaM that make it different than previous water management data models. i) The creative design of the WaM-DaM allows users to represent a network comprised of nodes and links instances. The instances can be created from customizable objects and their attributes of water management system components like reservoirs, canals, water use sites, and operations that involve those objects. ii) The Data Model also supports structured and explicit metadata fields that describe who collected data for the components, how, where, and when, the data were collected. iii) WaM-DaM manages data formats like time series, text, and parameter, multicolumn arrays and file based. Each of these data formats stores the data values in a relational data structure so users can directly access data content in WaM-DaM using the Structured Query Language (SQL). And iv) WaM-DaM uses controlled vocabulary to promote consistency in the use of terms for objects (e.g., reservoir and canal) and attributes (e.g., flowrate and diameter). The use of controlled vocabulary serves as a reference standard of interoperability between models as WaM-DaM. The controlled vocabulary complies with a defined ontology of water management data. The ontology in this context is a method to represent controlled vocabulary terms as a set of concepts and the relationships between them. Therefore, users can expand the list of controlled vocabulary by following their ontology of concepts. In this document I elaborate on the need for controlled vocabulary, the method I am using to develop them, the working results I have so far, and future work.


### Motivation
Water managers, researchers, and scientists have different backgrounds and interests in approaching and solving problems that are related to managing water in different contexts and scales like  supply, demand, or together. As a result, they use different jargon or terms to describe the same thing (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). For example, water management models describe the surface water reservoir with different terms like dam, pond, tank, levee, water body, and lake (Lehner et al., 2011). Some of these terms are synonyms (e.g., reservoir and dam) but others are not (e.g., lake and reservoir) (Piasecki and Beran, 2009). Similarly, models use different terms to describe variables or attributes like deliveries, release, outflow, discharge, diversion (HEC, 2007; SEI, 2012). Although all these variables may have the same unit of flowrate, they have different meaning based on the context they apply to. For example, the release term is used to describe the flowrate of water being released from a reservoir. The deliveries term is being used to describe the flowrate that is delivered to a demand site. Thus the context of the term is still needed to provide a full description of a term as it cannot stand by itself to be interpreted correctly (Lutz et al., 2009). 
This semantic heterogeneity describing water data leads to poor communication among collaborators and limits interoperability and exchange of information between models (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). However, the heterogeneity and discrepancies in describing the scientific data is inevitable and will continue to exist and therefore we need to build flexible data systems to accommodate this heterogeneity (Piasecki and Beran, 2009). The flexibility in data systems comes from defining a standard for a shared understanding of water management terms that can be interpreted correctly from the broad community whether involved directly in water management or not (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). So the standard should be beyond lists of controlled vocabulary which defined separately with no relations between it. This standard is defined as an ontology that represent terms as a set of concepts and the relationships between them (Simons et al., 2013; Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). Example ontology in the water management domain can be like a reservoir that is defined with these related concepts; stores fresh surface water behind a man-made structure for supply purposes. So compared to a controlled vocabulary term as a “reservoir”, ontology provides a set of concepts that give a better undemanding of what a reservoir mean and how it relates to concepts like surface water, fresh water, supply, and being man-made. Other terms can still belong or share similar set of concepts as in the term Lake. The Lake term is in this case is related to all the above concepts except that it is natural rather than man-made. Thus, Lake belongs to the concept “Natural”. This way of relating terms to a set of concepts makes the clear distinction between similar terms as either they share some of the concepts or differ in others. So defining how objects are related to each other gives the right meaning in the right context. For example, some scientists use the term reservoir to describe groundwater storage. Therefore relating a reservoir to the surface water concept reduces the confusion in the meaning of the reservoir in a particular context.
At the same time, the set of related concepts (e.g., surface water, man, made, public) serve as attributes to the controlled vocabulary terms like a reservoir. So we can use these explicit attributes to query large dataset and find answers to questions like: give me all the reservoirs in the Bear River Watershed in Utah that are man-made, public, and supply fresh surface water?. Another benefit to using ontology in water management is that users can unambiguously connect their models with WaM-DaM controlled vocabulary by examining the set of attributes these vocabulary have. For example, if a user wants to import their data about a “dam” in their model to WaM-DaM which has a controlled vocabulary term “Reservoir, then the user uses the defined ontology (e.g., a reservoir belongs to surface fresh water and man-made for supply purposes) and their judgment to examines if the “dam” meaning and functionality in the their model matches the term “reservoir” in WaM-DaM. If so, then both of these terms are synonyms and the data can be imported smoothly to WaM-DaM. Otherwise, the user has to find another term in WaM-DaM ontology to match their “dam” term in their model. So ontologies provide the ability to connect different vocabularies that share the same concept and thus support interoperability and communication between people and models over the same domain (Simons et al., 2013). Therefore, we need an ontology that represents the hierarchy of water management concepts and the relations between them. The next section elaborates on the Water Management Ontology and how it is being developed. The Appendix provides more details on a prior work example of ontology for the field of hydrologic observations data. 
### Water Management ontology 
As I articulated in the motivation, we need an ontology for water management data to overcome the semantic heterogeneity that exists in describing data from the broad range of scientists and researchers that deal with water management data. Therefore, I am developing a conceptual ontology for the water management data. I am compiling the hierarchy of water management terms into two levels: physical objects of nodes like reservoirs and demand sites (Figure 1) and links like rivers and canals (Figure 2), and their attributes like flowrate and capacity (Figure 3). Once the ontology is finalized, we will publish it and register it with a web service that allows users to suggest new additions. The suggestion will be evaluated to see whether it is redundant or new and where to add it on the ontology tree. Note that the ontology can be expanded by adding new branches or leaves to objects. For example, a user can suggest types of major “Reservoirs” to further describe what a reservoir is by adding branches to the “Reservoir” term like Storage, Hydropower, and Flood. The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI) could interested to help hosting the ontology and reviewing it. Figures 1, 2, and 3 are developed to have a better understanding of the hierarchy of water management data and do not necessarily follow a rigorous method. So I am reviewing the methods that are used to develop ontologies in other fields. 
Next steps include following a rigorous and consistent method in developing the water management ontology, reviewing data sources and models that deal with water management data and incorporate their terminology in the ontology. Your feedback is important to my work because the Calvin’s model uses enormous amount of different nodes and links. So please let me know whether this preliminary ontology meets your needs and what other nodes and links you need it to be added.     



To conclude, we need an ontology to describe water management data that provides a clear relationship between the controlled vocabularies of water management data in the right context. In this brief document, I explained the motivation for defining a water management ontology and I provided figures that show an example of the water management ontology and mentioned the next steps. Finally your feedback is important so I make sure that the ontology would meet your needs.

Appendix
Prior work in Ontology for the domain of hydrology
The Observation Data Model (ODM) provides a relational data structure to organize time series data and its associated metadata (Horsburgh et al., 2008). The ODM used controlled vocabulary to enforce homogeneity of metadata through look up tables for several key metadata fields like variable names and units. The controlled vocabulary therefore maintains consistent use of terms for time series data that is generated from the water and environmental sciences. However, the strict use of controlled vocabulary to describe time series data have a big limitation when other people from other disciplines want to search for existing data or share their data with others (Piasecki and Beran, 2009). For example, ODM uses the term “discharge” as a controlled vocabulary to describe flowrate but if a user wants to search for time series data for a variable called “stream flowrate”, then the database query returns nothing because the term “stream flowrate” does not exist or match the term “discharge” though they both mean the same thing.
To solve this obstacle, Piasecki and Beran (2009) developed an ontology for hydrologic observations which relates hydrological concepts in hierarchal ontology. The ontology is called HydroTagger and used as semantic annotation tool to connect arbitrary variable names used by the ODM controlled vocabulary and the broad community at the same time. Piasecki and Beran (2009) organized the hierarchal ontology through four layers that describe variables from general to specific. These layers are Navigation, Compound, Core/Leaf, and Variable (Figure 1). The navigation layer is the most general layer which starts with Hydrosphere then provides classification of major divisions to specify the navigation to like where (e.g., land and surface water) and what (e.g., water and soil quality). The second Compound layer emphasizes on the “what” aspect of the Navigation layer. For example, the layer provides specificity of the chimerical parameters as nutrients, macro nutrients, and then nitrogen. This content of this second layer can be searched by the user keywords when they look for match to their own variable to find where it would belong to. The third Core/Leaf layer represents the end of the ontology branch and defines a specific concept. This concept can be searched by the user and at the same time it can be tagged (or registered) with synonyms terms. Tagging or registering terms means that the user can create a link between or pair their own variable with the concept in the ontology tree. For example as shown in Figure 1, the Nitrate Nitrogen concept is tagged or paired with 26 variables that are used by different agencies. The last Variable Layer contains all the variables that are tagged in the above layer and thus each variable has its own unique identity number. You can visualize the ontology of the hydrologic semantic ontology at this webpage http://hiscentral.cuahsi.org/startree.html. Note that you need to lower the security of settings of Java to “Medium” in the Java Control Panel to allow the program to run on your browser. I should work in the Google Chrome browser.
